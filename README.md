Have you ever wanted to use your 3DS as a mouse ? No ?
Well have you ever wanted a graphical tablet but have no money to afford it but you have a 3DS ? Now we're talking huh ?

LETMEDRAWINPC allow you to use your touch screen to control remotely the cursor of your PC. Like a tablet with a pen.

For now, only the left click is simulated by the A button of our dear console. But the goal is to be able to simulate mouse or keyboard inputs as well with the buttons of the console. and assign a button to multiple keys, like the SELECT button for Alt + F4.
