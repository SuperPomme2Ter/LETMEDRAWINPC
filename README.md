Have you ever wanted to use your 3DS as a mouse ? No ?
Well have you ever wanted a graphical tablet but have no money to afford it but you have a 3DS ? Now we're talking huh ?

LETMEDRAWINPC allow you to use your touch screen to control remotely the cursor of your PC, like a tablet with a pen, and use the buttons of the console as keyboard or mouse keys.
